-- Classics --

Blinky 	- The pure classic, chases PacMan directly.
Pinky 	- The embusher, tries to approach PacMan from the front.
Inky	- The trickster, has for target the oposite spot of blinky in relative to PacMan. [WARNING: You cannot put Inky first. He pairs up with the *previous* ghost you've inputed. Meaning you may also pair it with other ghosts!]
Clyde	- The.. stupid- Ahem, behaves like Blinky but scatters whenever he gets too close. (8 tiles away.)
